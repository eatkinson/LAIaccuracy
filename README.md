Calculations of accuracy comparing simulations to RFmix runs


Ancestry call accuracy from rfmix v2 was compared to known simulated individuals, using Amy Williams's script to simulate KhoeSan individuals. Then ran RFmix Version 2 on the simulated files 2 ways. One replicating the original runs that Caitlyn did, and the second using the new method in version 2 that recalls ancestry for reference populations. The included python scripts tabulate how often sites were truly called as the ancestry they were over an individual globally, and how often sites for a particular ancestry were correctly called.
